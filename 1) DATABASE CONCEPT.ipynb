    "## Characteristics of Database Management System\n",
    "> A database management system has following characteristics:\n",
    " \n",
    "   1.Data stored into Tables:\n",
    "        * Data is never directly stored into the database.\n",
    "        * Data is stored into tables, created inside the database. \n",
    "        * DBMS also allows to have relationships between tables which makes the data more meaningful and connected. \n",
    "        * You can easily understand what type of data is stored where by looking at all the tables created in a database.\n",
    "   2.Reduced Redundancy: \n",
    "        * In the modern world hard drives are very cheap, but earlier when hard drives were too expensive, \n",
    "        * unnecessary repetition of data in database was a big problem.\n",
    "        * But DBMS follows Normalisation which divides the data in such a way that repetition is minimum.\n",
    "   3.Data Consistency: \n",
    "        * On Live data, i.e. data that is being continuosly updated and added, \n",
    "        * maintaining the consistency of data can become a challenge. But DBMS handles it all by itself.\n",
    "   4.Support Multiple user and Concurrent Access:\n",
    "        * DBMS allows multiple users to work on it(update, insert, delete data) \n",
    "        * at the same time and still manages to maintain the data consistency.\n",
    "   5.Query Language: \n",
    "        * DBMS provides users with a simple Query language, \n",
    "        * using which data can be easily fetched, inserted, \n",
    "        * deleted and updated in a database.\n",
    "   6.Security: \n",
    "        * The DBMS also takes care of the security of data, protecting the data from un-authorised access.\n",
    "        * In a typical DBMS, we can create user accounts with different access permissions, \n",
    "        * using which we can easily secure our data by restricting user access.\n",
    "   7.DBMS supports transactions,\n",
    "        * which allows us to better handle and manage data integrity in real world applications\n",
    "        * where multi-threading is extensively used."
