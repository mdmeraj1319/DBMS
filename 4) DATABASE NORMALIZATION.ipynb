    "    * like Insertion, Update and Deletion Anomalies.\n",
    "    * It is a multi-step process that puts data into tabular form,\n",
    "    * removing duplicated data from the relation tables.\n",

    "> Normalization is used for mainly two purposes,\n",
    "\n",
    "    1) Eliminating redundant(useless) data.\n",
    "    2) Ensuring data dependencies make sense i.e data is logically stored.\n",

    "    * then it will not only eat up extra memory space but will also make\n",
    "    * it difficult to handle and update the database,without facing data loss.\n",
    "    * Insertion, Updation and Deletion Anomalies are very frequent if database is not normalized.\n",

    "    * Suppose for a new admission, until and unless a student opts for a branch, \n",
    "    * data of the student cannot be inserted, or else we will have to set the branch information as NULL.\n",
    "    * Also, if we have to insert data of 100 students of same branch, \n",
    "    * then the branch information will be repeated for all those 100 students.\n",
    "    * These scenarios are nothing but Insertion anomalies.\n",

    "    * What if Mr. X leaves the college? or is no longer the HOD of computer science department?\n",

    "   ### Rule 2: Attribute Domain should not change\n",

    "    * In each column the values stored must be of the same kind or type.\n",
    "\n",
