    "        * it must be able to manage database entirely through the relational capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    ">     2)Rule 1: Information rule-\n",
    "        * All information(including metadata) is to be represented as stored data in cells of tables. \n",

    "        * Null has several meanings, it can mean missing data, not applicable or no value.\n",

    "        * Database dictionary(catalog) is the structure description of the complete Database and \n",

    "## RDBMS-\n",
    "     * RDBMS is used to manage Relational database. \n",
    "     * Relational database is a collection of organized set of tables related to each other\n",
    "## Table-\n",
    "     * table is a collection of data elements organised in terms of rows and columns. \n",
    "     * A table is also considered as a convenient representation of relations.\n",
    "     * But a table can have duplicate row of data while a true relation cannot have duplicate data\n",
    " ![VIEW](images/rdbms.png)\n",
    "## Tuple-\n",
    "     * A single entry in a table is called a Tuple or Record or Row.\n",
    "     * A tuple in a table represents a set of related data.  \n",
    "## Attributes-\n",
    "     * A table consists of several records(row),\n",
    "     * each record can be broken down into several smaller parts of data known as Attributes\n",
    "## Attribute Domain-\n",
    "     * When an attribute is defined in a relation(table), \n",
    "     * it is defined to hold only a certain type of values, which is known as Attribute Domain.\n",
    "## Relation Schema- ![view](images/image19-min-7.png)\n",
    "     * A relation schema describes the structure of the relation, \n",
    "     * with the name of the relation(name of table), its attributes and their names and type.\n",
    "## Relation Key-\n",
    "     * A relation key is an attribute which can uniquely identify a particular tuple(row) in a relation(table).\n",
    "## Relational Integrity Constraints-![view](images/img021.gif)\n",
    "     * Every relation in a relational database model should follow a few constraints to be a valid relation,\n",
    "     * these constraints are called as Relational Integrity Constraints.\n",
    "     * The three main Integrity Constraints are:\n",
    "          1) Key Constraints\n",
    "              *  In every table one or more than one attributes together are used to fetch data from tables.\n",
    "              *  The Key Constraint specifies that there should be such an attribute(column) in a relation(table), \n",
    "              *  which can be used to fetch data for any tuple(row).\n",
    "              *  The Key attribute should never be NULL or same for two different row of data. \n",
    "          2) Domain Constraints\n",
    "              *  Domain constraints refers to the rules defined for the values that can be stored for a certain attribute.\n",
    "              *  we cannot store Address of employee in the column for Name.\n",
    "              *  Similarly, a mobile number cannot exceed 10 digits.\n",
    "          3) Referential integrity Constraints\n",
    "              *  We will study about this in detail later. For now remember this example,\n",
    "              * if I say Shristi is my girlfriend, \n",
    "              * then a girl with name Shristi should also exist for that relationship to be present.\n",
    "\n",
    "              * If a table reference to some data from another table, \n",
    "              * then that table and that data should be present for referential integrity constraint to hold true."
